-> Breakout

Polymorphsim:
-> many forms
2 types of Polymorphism 
1. Method overloading -> complie time Polymorphsim
2. Method overriding -> Run time Polymorphisn (not use in Playwright, but can be done only with help of inheritance)

Method Overloading :
Inside the same class we can create multiple method with same methodname ,but 
different parameters should be passed 

calss Base{
ElementClick(locator: string):void
ElementClick(locator: string,forceClick:boolean):void

//implementation
ElementClick(locator: string,forceClick?:boolean){
if(forceClick == true){
console.log("click with force")
}
else{
console.log("click without force")
}
}
}

Method Overriding:
use With only inheritance
connect between two different calss with same method signature and parameters only
implementation can change

export class parent{

phone(){
console.log(button phone)
}
}
//object -> button phone

class child extendds parent{
phone(){
console.log(iphone)
}
}
//pbject child -> iphone

//if we are creating 2 classes in a file 
// we can use extendds in one class and no need to use export and import
