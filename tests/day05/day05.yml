XPath 
-> there are around 14 types of xpath
-> mostly we will use 9 types from that in real time

--> Attribute based xpath
//tagname[@attributename='attributeValue']

--> Text based xpath
//tagname[text()='Textvalue']

--> partial attribute based xpath
//tagname[contains(@attributename,'partial text value')]

--> partial text based xpath 
//tagname[contains(text(),'partial text value')]

--> collection based xpath
(//tagname[@attributename='attributeValue'])[index value]
Note: index value -> should start with  1 and should not go beyond 5.
if it goes beyond 5 we shall use advanced xpath 

Xpath- Axes (Advanced Xpath)
--> parent to child xpath 
(parent relative xpath)/(tagname of the child)

--> grandparent to grancchild xpath
grandParent relative path//tagname of grandChild

--> child to parent
child relative xpath/parent::parent tagname

--> grandChild to grandparent
grandchild relative xpath/ancestor::tagname of grandParent

--> elder sibling to younger sibling 
(elder sibling relative xpath)/following-sibling::tagname of younger sibling

--> younger sibling to elder sibling
younger sibling relative xpath /preceding-sibling::tagname of elder sibling

--> Elder cousin to younger cousin
elder cousin relative xpath /following::tagname of younger cousin

--> younger cousin to Elder cousin 
younger cousin relative xpath/preceding::tagname of elder cousin
