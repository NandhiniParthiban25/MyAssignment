Agenda:
-> Xpath (continue)
-> Playwright Locators
-> Break
-> Breakout
-> Assertions
-> Type Script



Note: 
to run/execute a js file 
--> node node filename.js

to run/execute a spec file 
--> npx playwright test filename.spec.ts

to debug a spec file 
--> npx playwright test filename.spec.ts --debug

to execute a ts file (only if typescript is installed globally)
--> tsc filename.ts
then --> node filename.js

to execute a ts file (only if typescript (ts-node) is installed globally)
--> ts-node filename.ts

Playwright Locators:
 
-> getByRole - text,button,checkbox,link,radio,heading
-> getByLabel
-> getByText
-> getByPlaceholder
-> getByAltText - img
-> getByDataTestId


Playwright Assertions:
Types:
1. Auto Retry -> will retry if the element is not found
2. Non-Retry -> will not retry if the element is not found
3. soft -> will execute the rest of the code if error occurs
4. hard -> will not execute the rest of the code if error occurs, it will terminae the code

Note: By default time for assertion is 5 seconds

Assertions types:
Generic Type - toEqual, toHaveTitle
Locator Type - toBeEnabled
page Type - toHaveURL
API Assertions
Negating Assertions
expect().not

Refer: https://playwright.dev/docs/test-assertions

Note: if we are adding extra time to the asserting it is called actionability timeout
syntax: await expect(page.locator("")).toBeEnabled({timeout:10000})
